##About
This lesson explains what shapefile attributes are and how to
work with shapefile attributes in `R`. It also covers how to identify and query 
shapefile attributes as well as subset shapefiles by specific attribute values. 
Finally, we will review how to plot a shapefile according to a set of attribute 
values.

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - you've got the basics of `R` down.

**Vector Lesson Series:** This lesson is part of a lesson series on 
[vector data in R ]({{ site.baseurl }}self-paced-tutorials/spatial-vector-series).
It is also part of a larger 
[spatio-temporal Data Carpentry Workshop ]({{ site.baseurl }}self-paced-tutorials/spatio-temporal-workshop)
that includes working with
[raster data in R ]({{ site.baseurl }}self-paced-tutorials/spatial-raster-series) 
and [tabular time series in R ]({{ site.baseurl }}self-paced-tutorials/tabular-time-series).

##Shapefile Metadata & Attributes
When we import a shapefile into `R`, the `readOGR()` function automatically
stores metadata and attributes associated with the file.

##Load the Data
To work with vector data in `R`, we can use the `rgdal` library. The `raster` 
package also allows us to explore metadata using similar commands for both
rasters and vectors. 

We will first, import three shapefiles. The first is our `AOI` or area of
interest boundary polygon that we worked with in 
[Lesson 00 - Vector Data in R - Open and Plot Shapefiles]({{site.baseurl}}R/open-shapefiles-in-R/). 
The second is a shapefile containing the location of roads within the field
site. Finally we will import a file containing the Fisher tower location.

If you completed the
[Vector Data in R - Open and Plot Shapefiles]({{site.baseurl}}R/open-shapefiles-in-R/ ) 
lesson, you can skip this code chunk.

```{r load-packages-data }
#load packages
#rgdal: for vector work; sp package should always load with rgdal. 
library(rgdal)  
#raster: for metadata/attributes- vectors or rasters
library (raster)   

#set working directory to data folder
#setwd("pathToDirHere")

#Import a polygon shapefile 
aoiBoundary_HARV <- readOGR("NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/",
                            "HarClip_UTMZ18")

#Import a line shapefile
lines_HARV <- readOGR( "NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/", "HARV_roads")

#Import a point shapefile 
point_HARV <- readOGR("NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/",
                      "HARVtower_UTM18N")

```

##Query Shapefile Metadata 
Remember, as covered in Lesson 00, we can view metadata associated with 
an `R` using:

* `class()` - Determine the type of vector data stored in the object
* `length()` - How many features are in this spatial object?
* object `extent()` - the spatial extent (geographic area covered by) features 
in the object
* coordinate reference system (`CRS`) - The spatial projection that the data are
in. 

Let's explore the metadata for our `point_HARV` object. 

```{r view-shapefile-metadata }
#view class
class(x = point_HARV)

# x= isn't actually needed; it just specifies which object
#view features count
length(point_HARV)

#view crs - note - this only works with the raster package loaded
crs(point_HARV)

#view extent- note - this only works with the raster package loaded
extent(point_HARV)

#view metadata summary
point_HARV
```


##About Shapefile Attributes
Shapefiles often contain an associated database or spreadsheet of values called
`attributes` that describe the vector features in the shapefile. You can think
of this like a spreadsheet with rows and columns. Each column in the spreadsheet
is an individual `attribute` that describes an object (sometimes called
variables). Shapefile `attributes` include measurements that correspond to the
geometry of the shapefile features.

For example, the Roads shapefile (`lines_HARV` object) contains an attribute
called `TYPE`. Each line in the shapefile has an associated `TYPE` which 
describes the type of road (road, footpath, boardwalk, etc).  

We can look at all of the associated data attributes by printing the contents of
the `data` slot with `@data`. We can use the base `R` `length` function to count
the number of attributes associated with a spatial object too.

```{r shapefile-attributes}
#just view the attributes & first 6attribute values of the data
head(lines_HARV@data)

#how many attributes are in our data?
length(lines_HARV@data)

```


We can view the individual NAMES of each attribute using the
`names(lines_HARV@data)` method in `R`. We can also view just the first 6 rows
of attribute values using  `head(lines_HARV@data)`. 

Let's give it a try.

```{r view-shapefile-attributes }
#view just the attribute names for the lines spatial object
names(lines_HARV@data)

```


<div id="challenge" markdown="1">
##Challenge: Attributes for Different Spatial Classes
Explore the attributes associated with the `point_HARV` and `aoiBoundary_HARV` 
spatial objects. 

1. How many attributes do each have?
2. Who owns the site in the `point_HARV` data object?
3. Which of the following are NOT attributes of the `point` data object?

    A) Latitude      B) County     C) Country
</div>

```{r challenge-code-attributes-classes, results="hide", echo=FALSE}
#1
length(names(point_HARV@data))  #14 attributes
names(aoiBoundary_HARV@data)  #1 attribute

#2
head(point_HARV@data)  #Harvard University, LTER

#3
point_HARV@data  # C Country
```

##Explore Values within One Attribute
We can explore individual values stored within a particular attribute.
Again, comparing attributes to a spreadsheet or a `data.frame`, this is similar
to exploring values in a column. We can do this using the `$` and the name of
the attribute. 

```{r explore-attribute-values }
#view all attributes in the lines shapefile within the TYPE field
lines_HARV$TYPE

```

###Subset Shapefiles
Using the `$` symbol, we can access the values associated with a particular
`attribute` in a shapefile. We can use this syntax to select a subset of
features from a spatial object in `R`. 

```{r Subsetting-shapefiles}
#view all attributes in the TYPE column
lines_HARV$TYPE

# select features that are of TYPE "footpath"
# could put this code into other function to only have that function work on
# "footpath" lines
lines_HARV[lines_HARV$TYPE == "footpath",]

#save an object with only footpath lines
footpath_HARV<-lines_HARV[lines_HARV$TYPE == "footpath",]
footpath_HARV
#how many features in our new object
length(footpath_HARV)

#plot just footpaths
plot(footpath_HARV,
     lwd=6,
     main="Footpaths at NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")
```

Our subsetting operation reduces the `features` count from 13 to 2. This means
that only two lines have the attribute "TYPE=footpath".

##Plot Lines by Attribute Value

To plot vector data, colored by a set of attribute values, we can convert an
attribute that has categorical data to class= `factor`. A factor is similar to a
category - you can group vector objects by a particular category value - for
example you can group all lines of `TYPE=footpath`. However in `R`, a factor
can also have an *order*. 

If we convert the `lines_HARV$TYPE` column to a factor using `as.factor()`, then
it will be much easier to plot features by attribute value.


```{r convert-to-factor }
#view the original class of the TYPE column
class(lines_HARV$TYPE)
#view levels or categories - not that there are no categories yet in our data!
#the attributes are just read as a list of character elements.
levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)

#Convert the TYPE attribute into a factor
lines_HARV$TYPE <- as.factor(lines_HARV$TYPE)
#the class is now a factor
class(lines_HARV$TYPE)
#view the levels or categories associated with TYPE (4 total)
levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)

#how many features are in each category or level?
summary(lines_HARV$TYPE)

#plot the lines data, apply a diff color to each category
plot(lines_HARV, col=lines_HARV$TYPE,
     lwd=3,
     main="Roads at the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")
```


###Adjust Line Width
We can adjust the width of our plot lines too using `lwd`. We can set all lines
to be thicker or thinner using `lwd=`. Or given we have a factor with 4 levels, 
we can provide an vector of numbers, each of which represents the thickness of
one of our four levels or categories as follows:
     
```{r adjust-line-width}
#make all lines thicker
plot(lines_HARV, col=lines_HARV$TYPE,
     main="Roads at the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site",
     lwd=6)

levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)
#adjust width of each level
#in this case, boardwalk (the first level) is the widest.
plot(lines_HARV, col=lines_HARV$TYPE,
     main="Roads at the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site \n Boardwalk Line Width Wider",
     lwd=c(10,2,3,4))

```     

##Add Plot Legend

We can add a legend to our plot too. When we add a legend, we can use
the following elements to specify labels and colors:

* `levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)` - Label the legend elements using the categories of 
`levels` in our `TYPE` attribute (boardwalk, footpath, etc).
* `fill=palette()` - apply unique colors to the boxes in our legend. 
`palette()` is the default set of colors that `R` applies to all plots. 
* We can specify the **location** of our legend too. Let's use `bottomright` for 
this plot. We could also use `top`, `topright`, etc.

Let's add a legend to our plot.

```{r add-legend-to-plot }
plot(lines_HARV, col=lines_HARV$TYPE,
     main="Roads at the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Default Legend")
#add a legend to our map
legend("bottomright", NULL, levels(lines_HARV$TYPE), fill=palette())

```

We can tweak the appearance of our legend too.

* `bty=n` - turn off the legend BORDER
* `cex` - make the font size smaller

Let's try it out.

```{r modify-legend-plot }
plot(lines_HARV, col=lines_HARV$TYPE,
     main="Roads at the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site \n Modified Legend")
#add a legend to our map
legend("bottomright", levels(lines_HARV$TYPE), fill=palette(), bty="n", cex=.8)

```

The default color palette in R is accessed by the `palette()` command. We can 
modify this list of colors to create a prettier looking plot!

```{r adjust-palette-colors}
#view default colors
palette()

#manually set the colors for the plot!
palette(c("springgreen", "blue", "magenta", "red") )
palette()

#plot using new colors
plot(lines_HARV, col=lines_HARV$TYPE,
     main="Roads at the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site \n Pretty Colors")
#add a legend to our map
legend("bottomright", levels(lines_HARV$TYPE), fill=palette(), bty="n", cex=.8)

```

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** You can apply built in colors ramps to 
your palette too. For example `palette(rainbow(6))` or
`palette(terrain.colors(6))`. 
You can reset the palette colors using `palette("default")` if need be!

##Challenge: Plot Lines by Attribute
Create a plot that emphasizes only roads where bicycles and horses are allowed. 
NOTE: this attribute information is located in the `lines_HARV$BicyclesHo` 
attribute.  

Be sure to add a title and legend to your map! You might consider a color
palette that has all bike/horse-friendly roads displayed in a bright color.  All
other lines might be grey.

</div>

```{r bicycle-map, include=TRUE, results="hide", echo=FALSE}
#view levels 
levels(lines_HARV$BicyclesHo)

#convert to factor if necessary
lines_HARV$BicyclesHo <- as.factor(lines_HARV$BicyclesHo)
levels(lines_HARV$BicyclesHo)
#remove NA values
lines_removeNA <- lines_HARV[na.omit(lines_HARV$BicyclesHo),]
#set colors so only the allowed roads are magenta
palette(c("magenta","grey","grey"))
palette()
#plot using new colors
plot(lines_HARV, col=lines_HARV$BicyclesHo,
     lwd=4,
     main="Roads Where Bikes and Horses Are Allowed \n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")
#add a legend to our map
legend("bottomright", 
       levels(lines_HARV$BicyclesHo), 
       fill=palette(), 
       bty="n", cex=.8)

```

##Plot Multiple Vector Layers
Now, let's create a plot that combines our tower location (`point_HARV`), 
site boundary (`aoiBoundary_HARV`) and roads (`lines_HARV`) spatial objects. We
will need to BUILD a custom legend as well.

To begin, create a plot with the site boundary as the first layer. Then layer 
the tower location and road data on top using `add=TRUE`.  

```{r challenge-answer, echo=FALSE}

#Plot multiple shapefiles
plot(aoiBoundary_HARV, col = "grey93", border="grey",
     main="NEON Harvard Forest\nField Site")
plot(lines_HARV, 
     col=lines_HARV$TYPE,
     add = TRUE)
plot(point_HARV, add  = TRUE, pch = 19, col = "purple")

#assign plot to an object for easy modification!
plot_HARV<- recordPlot()
```

To create a legend that includes both the road elements, the tower location and 
the AOI polygon, we will need to build three things

1. a list of all "labels" to use in the legend
2. a list of colors as they appear in our plot
3. a list of symbols to use in the plot

Let's create objects for the labels, colors and symbols so we can easily reuse
them.

```{r customize-legend }

#create a list of all labels
labels <- c("Tower", "AOI", levels(lines_HARV$TYPE))
labels

#create a list of colors to use 
plotColors <- c("purple", "grey",fill=palette())
plotColors

#create a list of pch values
#these are the symbols that will be used for each legend value
# ?pch will provide more information on values
plotSym <- c(16,15,15,15,15,15)
plotSym

#Plot multiple shapefiles
plot_HARV

#to create a custom legend, we need to fake it
legend("bottomright", 
       legend=labels,
       pch=plotSym, 
       bty="n", 
       col=plotColors,
       cex=.8)

```

We are almost there! It might be more useful to use line symbols in our legend
rather than squares to better represent our data. We can create a line symbol
using `lty = ()`. We have a total of 6 elements in our legend:

1.   Tower Location
2.   AOI
3-6. Road levels (categories)

The `lty` list designates, in order, which of those elements should be
designated as a line (`1`) and which should be designated as a symbol (`NA`).
Our object will thus look like `lty = c(NA,NA,1,1,1,1)`. This tells `R` to use a
line element for`the 3-6 elements in our legend only. 

Once we do this, we need to *modify* our `pch` element. Each *line* element
(3-6) should be represented by a `NA` value - this tells `R` to not use a
symbol, but to instead use a line.


```{r refine-legend}
#Create line object
lineLegend = c(NA,NA,1,1,1,1)
lineLegend
plotSym <- c(16,15,NA,NA,NA,NA)
plotSym

#Plot multiple shapefiles
plot_HARV

#to create a custom legend, we need to fake it
legend("bottomright", 
       legend=labels, 
       lty = lineLegend,
       pch=plotSym, 
       bty="n", 
       col=plotColors,
       cex=.9)

```

##Challenge: Plot Color by Attribute

1. Create a map of the State boundaries in the United States - using the data
located in your downloaded data folder: `NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/US-Boundary-Layers\US-State-Boundaries-Census-2014`. 
Each state should be a different color or shade of color. 
HINT: you can use `palette(terrain.colors((50))` to create a palette of 50
colors using the `terrain.colors` `R` palette. 

2. Using the `NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/PlotLocations_HARV.shp` shapefile, 
create a map of field site locations, with each point colored by the soil type
(`soilTypeOr`). 
Experiment with using one of the other 
<a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/grDevices/html/palettes.html" target="_blank">R Color Palettes</a>.

How many different soil types are there at this particular field site? 

</div>

``` {r challenge-code-plot-color, results="hide", warning= FALSE, echo=FALSE}
##1
#Read the .csv file
State.Boundary.US <- readOGR("NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/US-Boundary-Layers",
          "US-State-Boundaries-Census-2014")

palette(terrain.colors((50)))
palette()

plot(State.Boundary.US,
     col=State.Boundary.US$NAME,
     main="Contiguious US States \n in 50 Colors")

##2
#open plot locations
plotLocations <- readOGR("NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV",
          "PlotLocations_HARV")

#how many unique soils?  Two
unique(plotLocations$soilTypeOr)

#create new color palette -- topo.colors palate
palette(topo.colors((2)))
palette()

#plot the locations 
plot(plotLocations,
     col=plotLocations$soilTypeOr, pch=18,
     main="NEON Field Sites by Soil Type")

#create legend 
legend("bottomright", 
       legend=c("Intceptisols","Histosols"),
       pch=18, 
       col=palette(),
       bty="n", 
       cex=1)

```
