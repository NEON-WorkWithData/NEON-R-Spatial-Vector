##About
This lesson explains what shapefile attributes are and how to
work with shapefile attributes in `R`. It also covers how to identify and query 
shapefile attributes as well as subset shapefiles by specific attribute values. 
Finally, we will review how to plot a shapefile according to a set of attribute 
values.

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - you've got the basics of `R` down.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">

**Vector Lesson Series:** This lesson is part of a lesson series on 
[vector data in R ]({{ site.baseurl }}self-paced-tutorials/spatial-vector-series).
It is also part of a larger 
[spatio-temporal Data Carpentry Workshop ]({{ site.baseurl }}self-paced-tutorials/spatio-temporal-workshop)
that includes working with
[raster data in R ]({{ site.baseurl }}self-paced-tutorials/spatial-raster-series) 
and [tabular time series in R ]({{ site.baseurl }}self-paced-tutorials/tabular-time-series).

</div>

##Shapefile Metadata & Attributes
When we import a shapefile into `R`, the `readOGR()` function automatically
stores metadata and attributes associated with the file.

##Load the Data
To work with vector data in `R`, we can use the `rgdal` library. The `raster` 
package also allows us to explore metadata using similar commands for both
rasters and vectors. 

We will first, import three shapefiles. The first is our `AOI` or area of
interest boundary polygon that we worked with in 
[Lesson 00 - Vector Data in R - Open and Plot Shapefiles]({{site.baseurl}}R/open-shapefiles-in-R/). 
The second is a shapefile containing the location of roads within the field
site. Finally we will import a file containing the Fisher tower location.

If you completed the
[Vector Data in R - Open and Plot Shapefiles]({{site.baseurl}}R/open-shapefiles-in-R/ ) 
lesson, you can skip this code chunk.


    #load packages
    #rgdal: for vector work; sp package should always load with rgdal. 
    library(rgdal)  
    #raster: for metadata/attributes- vectors or rasters
    library (raster)   
    
    #set working directory to data folder
    #setwd("pathToDirHere")
    
    #Import a polygon shapefile 
    aoiBoundary_HARV <- readOGR("NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/",
                                "HarClip_UTMZ18")

    ## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
    ## Source: "NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/", layer: "HarClip_UTMZ18"
    ## with 1 features
    ## It has 1 fields

    #Import a line shapefile
    lines_HARV <- readOGR( "NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/", "HARV_roads")

    ## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
    ## Source: "NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/", layer: "HARV_roads"
    ## with 13 features
    ## It has 15 fields

    #Import a point shapefile 
    point_HARV <- readOGR("NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/",
                          "HARVtower_UTM18N")

    ## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
    ## Source: "NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/", layer: "HARVtower_UTM18N"
    ## with 1 features
    ## It has 14 fields

##Query Shapefile Metadata 
Remember, as covered in Lesson 00, we can view metadata associated with 
an `R` using:

* `class()` - Determine the type of vector data stored in the object
* `length()` - How many features are in this spatial object?
* object `extent()` - the spatial extent (geographic area covered by) features 
in the object
* coordinate reference system (`CRS`) - The spatial projection that the data are
in. 

Let's explore the metadata for our `point_HARV` object. 


    #view class
    class(x = point_HARV)

    ## [1] "SpatialPointsDataFrame"
    ## attr(,"package")
    ## [1] "sp"

    # x= isn't actually needed; it just specifies which object
    #view features count
    length(point_HARV)

    ## [1] 1

    #view crs - note - this only works with the raster package loaded
    crs(point_HARV)

    ## CRS arguments:
    ##  +proj=utm +zone=18 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84
    ## +towgs84=0,0,0

    #view extent- note - this only works with the raster package loaded
    extent(point_HARV)

    ## class       : Extent 
    ## xmin        : 732183.2 
    ## xmax        : 732183.2 
    ## ymin        : 4713265

##About Shapefile Attributes
Shapefiles often contain an associated database or spreadsheet of values called
`attributes` that describe the vector features in the shapefile. You can think
of this like a spreadsheet with rows and columns. Each column in the spreadsheet
is an individual `attribute` that describes an object (sometimes called
variables). Shapefile `attributes` include measurements that correspond to the
geometry of the shapefile features.

For example, the Roads shapefile (`lines_HARV` object) contains an attribute
called `TYPE`. Each line in the shapefile has an associated `TYPE` which 
describes the type of road (road, footpath, boardwalk, etc).

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/spatialVector/Attribute_Table.png"></a>
    <figcaption>The shapefile format allows us to store attributes for each feature
    (vector object) stored in the shapefile. The attribute table, is similar to 
    a spreadsheet. There is a row for each feature. The first column contains the 
    unique ID of the feature. We can add additional columns that describe the 
    feature.

</figure>

We can look at all of the associated data attributes by printing the contents of
the `data` slot with `@data`. We can use the base `R` `length` function to count
the number of attributes associated with a spatial object too.

    #how many attributes are in our data?
    length(lines_HARV@data)

    ## [1] 15


We can view the individual NAMES of each attribute using the
`names(lines_HARV@data)` method in `R`. We can also view just the first 6 rows
of attribute values using  `head(lines_HARV@data)`. 

Let's give it a try.


    #view just the attribute names for the lines spatial object
    names(lines_HARV@data)

    ##  [1] "OBJECTID_1" "OBJECTID"   "TYPE"       "NOTES"      "MISCNOTES" 
    ##  [6] "RULEID"     "MAPLABEL"   "SHAPE_LENG" "LABEL"      "BIKEHORSE" 
    ## [11] "RESVEHICLE" "RECMAP"     "Shape_Le_1" "ResVehic_1" "BicyclesHo"


<div id="challenge" markdown="1">
##Challenge: Attributes for Different Spatial Classes
Explore the attributes associated with the `point_HARV` and `aoiBoundary_HARV` 
spatial objects. 

1. How many attributes do each have?
2. Who owns the site in the `point_HARV` data object?
3. Which of the following are NOT attributes of the `point` data object?

    A) Latitude      B) County     C) Country
</div>



##Explore Values within One Attribute
We can explore individual values stored within a particular attribute.
Again, comparing attributes to a spreadsheet or a `data.frame`, this is similar
to exploring values in a column. We can do this using the `$` and the name of
the attribute. 


    #view all attributes in the lines shapefile within the TYPE field
    lines_HARV$TYPE

    ##  [1] woods road footpath   footpath   stone wall stone wall stone wall
    ##  [7] stone wall stone wall stone wall boardwalk  woods road woods road
    ## [13] woods road
    ## Levels: boardwalk footpath stone wall woods road

###Subset Shapefiles
Using the `$` symbol, we can access the values associated with a particular
`attribute` in a shapefile. We can use this syntax to select a subset of
features from a spatial object in `R`. 


    #view all attributes in the TYPE column
    lines_HARV$TYPE

    ##  [1] woods road footpath   footpath   stone wall stone wall stone wall
    ##  [7] stone wall stone wall stone wall boardwalk  woods road woods road
    ## [13] woods road
    ## Levels: boardwalk footpath stone wall woods road

    # select features that are of TYPE "footpath"
    # could put this code into other function to only have that function work on
    # "footpath" lines
    lines_HARV[lines_HARV$TYPE == "footpath",]

    ## class       : SpatialLinesDataFrame 
    ## features    : 2 
    ## extent      : 731954.5, 732232.3, 4713131, 4713726  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
    ## coord. ref. : +proj=utm +zone=18 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0

    ## min values  :         40,       91, footpath,    NA,        NA,      6,       NA,   146.2998,    NA,         Y,         R1,      Y,   146.2998,    R1 - All Research Vehicles Allowed, Bicycles and Horses Allowed 
    ## max values  :         41,      106, footpath,    NA,        NA,      6,       NA,   676.7180,    NA,         Y,         R2,      Y,   676.7181, R2 - 4WD/High Clearance Vehicles Only, Bicycles and Horses Allowed

    #save an object with only footpath lines
    footpath_HARV<-lines_HARV[lines_HARV$TYPE == "footpath",]
    footpath_HARV

    ## class       : SpatialLinesDataFrame 
    ## features    : 2 
    ## extent      : 731954.5, 732232.3, 4713131, 4713726  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)

    ## min values  :         40,       91, footpath,    NA,        NA,      6,       NA,   146.2998,    NA,         Y,         R1,      Y,   146.2998,    R1 - All Research Vehicles Allowed, Bicycles and Horses Allowed 
    ## max values  :         41,      106, footpath,    NA,        NA,      6,       NA,   676.7180,    NA,         Y,         R2,      Y,   676.7181, R2 - 4WD/High Clearance Vehicles Only, Bicycles and Horses Allowed

    #how many features in our new object
    length(footpath_HARV)

    ## [1] 2

    #plot just footpaths
    plot(footpath_HARV,
         lwd=6,
         main="Footpaths at NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/01-shapefile-attributes/Subsetting-shapefiles-1.png) 

Our subsetting operation reduces the `features` count from 13 to 2. This means
that only two lines have the attribute "TYPE=footpath".

##Plot Lines by Attribute Value

To plot vector data, colored by a set of attribute values, we can convert an
attribute that has categorical data to class= `factor`. A factor is similar to a
category - you can group vector objects by a particular category value - for
example you can group all lines of `TYPE=footpath`. However in `R`, a factor
can also have an *order*. 

If we convert the `lines_HARV$TYPE` column to a factor using `as.factor()`, then
it will be much easier to plot features by attribute value.



    #view the original class of the TYPE column
    class(lines_HARV$TYPE)

    ## [1] "factor"

    #view levels or categories - not that there are no categories yet in our data!
    #the attributes are just read as a list of character elements.
    levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)

    ## [1] "boardwalk"  "footpath"   "stone wall" "woods road"

    #Convert the TYPE attribute into a factor
    lines_HARV$TYPE <- as.factor(lines_HARV$TYPE)
    #the class is now a factor
    class(lines_HARV$TYPE)

    ## [1] "factor"

    #view the levels or categories associated with TYPE (4 total)
    levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)

    ## [1] "boardwalk"  "footpath"   "stone wall" "woods road"

    #how many features are in each category or level?
    summary(lines_HARV$TYPE)

    ##  boardwalk   footpath stone wall woods road 
    ##          1          2          6          4

    #plot the lines data, apply a diff color to each category
    plot(lines_HARV, col=lines_HARV$TYPE,
         lwd=3,
         main="Roads at the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/01-shapefile-attributes/convert-to-factor-1.png) 


###Adjust Line Width
We can adjust the width of our plot lines too using `lwd`. We can set all lines
to be thicker or thinner using `lwd=`. Or given we have a factor with 4 levels, 
we can provide an vector of numbers, each of which represents the thickness of
one of our four levels or categories as follows:
     

    #make all lines thicker
    plot(lines_HARV, col=lines_HARV$TYPE,
         main="Roads at the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site",
         lwd=6)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/01-shapefile-attributes/adjust-line-width-1.png) 

    levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)

    ## [1] "boardwalk"  "footpath"   "stone wall" "woods road"

    #adjust width of each level
    #in this case, boardwalk (the first level) is the widest.
    plot(lines_HARV, col=lines_HARV$TYPE,
         main="Roads at the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site \n Boardwalk Line Width Wider",
         lwd=c(10,2,3,4))

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/01-shapefile-attributes/adjust-line-width-2.png) 

##Add Plot Legend

We can add a legend to our plot too. When we add a legend, we can use
the following elements to specify labels and colors:

* `levels(lines_HARV$TYPE)` - Label the legend elements using the categories of 
`levels` in our `TYPE` attribute (boardwalk, footpath, etc).
* `fill=palette()` - apply unique colors to the boxes in our legend. 
`palette()` is the default set of colors that `R` applies to all plots. 
* We can specify the **location** of our legend too. Let's use `bottomright` for 
this plot. We could also use `top`, `topright`, etc.

Let's add a legend to our plot.


    plot(lines_HARV, col=lines_HARV$TYPE,
         main="Roads at the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site\n Default Legend")
    #add a legend to our map
    legend("bottomright", NULL, levels(lines_HARV$TYPE), fill=palette())

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/01-shapefile-attributes/add-legend-to-plot-1.png) 

We can tweak the appearance of our legend too.

* `bty=n` - turn off the legend BORDER
* `cex` - make the font size smaller

Let's try it out.


    plot(lines_HARV, col=lines_HARV$TYPE,
         main="Roads at the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site \n Modified Legend")
    #add a legend to our map
    legend("bottomright", levels(lines_HARV$TYPE), fill=palette(), bty="n", cex=.8)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/01-shapefile-attributes/modify-legend-plot-1.png) 

The default color palette in R is accessed by the `palette()` command. We can 
modify this list of colors to create a prettier looking plot!


    #view default colors
    palette()

    ## [1] "#4C00FF" "#00E5FF"

    #manually set the colors for the plot!
    palette(c("springgreen", "blue", "magenta", "red") )
    palette()

    ## [1] "springgreen" "blue"        "magenta"     "red"

    #plot using new colors
    plot(lines_HARV, col=lines_HARV$TYPE,
         main="Roads at the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site \n Pretty Colors")
    #add a legend to our map
    legend("bottomright", levels(lines_HARV$TYPE), fill=palette(), bty="n", cex=.8)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/01-shapefile-attributes/adjust-palette-colors-1.png) 

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** You can apply built in colors ramps to 
your palette too. For example `palette(rainbow(6))` or
`palette(terrain.colors(6))`. 
You can reset the palette colors using `palette("default")` if need be!

##Challenge: Plot Lines by Attribute
Create a plot that emphasizes only roads where bicycles and horses are allowed. 
NOTE: this attribute information is located in the `lines_HARV$BicyclesHo` 
attribute.  

Be sure to add a title and legend to your map! You might consider a color
palette that has all bike/horse-friendly roads displayed in a bright color.  All
other lines might be grey.

##Plot Multiple Vector Layers
Now, let's create a plot that combines our tower location (`point_HARV`), 
site boundary (`aoiBoundary_HARV`) and roads (`lines_HARV`) spatial objects. We
will need to BUILD a custom legend as well.

To begin, create a plot with the site boundary as the first layer. Then layer 
the tower location and road data on top using `add=TRUE`.  

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/01-shapefile-attributes/challenge-answer-1.png) 

To create a legend that includes both the road elements, the tower location and 
the AOI polygon, we will need to build three things

1. a list of all "labels" to use in the legend
2. a list of colors as they appear in our plot
3. a list of symbols to use in the plot

Let's create objects for the labels, colors and symbols so we can easily reuse
them.


    #create a list of all labels
    labels <- c("Tower", "AOI", levels(lines_HARV$TYPE))
    labels

    ## [1] "Tower"      "AOI"        "boardwalk"  "footpath"   "stone wall"
    ## [6] "woods road"

    #create a list of colors to use 
    plotColors <- c("purple", "grey",fill=palette())
    plotColors

    ##                         fill1     fill2     fill3 
    ##  "purple"    "grey" "magenta"    "gray"    "gray"

    #create a list of pch values
    #these are the symbols that will be used for each legend value
    # ?pch will provide more information on values
    plotSym <- c(16,15,15,15,15,15)
    plotSym

    ## [1] 16 15 15 15 15 15

    #Plot multiple shapefiles
    plot_HARV
    
    #to create a custom legend, we need to fake it
    legend("bottomright", 
           legend=labels,
           pch=plotSym, 
           bty="n", 
           col=plotColors,
           cex=.8)

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/01-shapefile-attributes/customize-legend-1.png) 

We are almost there! It might be more useful to use line symbols in our legend
rather than squares to better represent our data. We can create a line symbol
using `lty = ()`. We have a total of 6 elements in our legend:

1.   Tower Location
2.   AOI
3-6. Road levels (categories)

The `lty` list designates, in order, which of those elements should be
designated as a line (`1`) and which should be designated as a symbol (`NA`).
Our object will thus look like `lty = c(NA,NA,1,1,1,1)`. This tells `R` to use a
line element for`the 3-6 elements in our legend only. 

Once we do this, we need to *modify* our `pch` element. Each *line* element
(3-6) should be represented by a `NA` value - this tells `R` to not use a
symbol, but to instead use a line.



    #Create line object
    lineLegend = c(NA,NA,1,1,1,1)
    lineLegend

    ## [1] NA NA  1  1  1  1

    plotSym <- c(16,15,NA,NA,NA,NA)
    plotSym

    ## [1] 16 15 NA NA NA NA

    #Plot multiple shapefiles
    plot_HARV
    
    #to create a custom legend, we need to fake it
    legend("bottomright", 
           legend=labels, 
           lty = lineLegend,
           pch=plotSym, 
           bty="n", 
           col=plotColors,
           cex=.9)

##Challenge: Plot Color by Attribute

1. Create a map of the State boundaries in the United States - using the data
located in your downloaded data folder: `NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/US-Boundary-Layers\US-State-Boundaries-Census-2014`. 
Each state should be a different color or shade of color. 
HINT: you can use `palette(terrain.colors((50))` to create a palette of 50
colors using the `terrain.colors` `R` palette. 

2. Using the `NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/PlotLocations_HARV.shp` shapefile, 
create a map of field site locations, with each point colored by the soil type
(`soilTypeOr`). 
Experiment with using one of the other 
<a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/grDevices/html/palettes.html" target="_blank">R Color Palettes</a>.

How many different soil types are there at this particular field site?
