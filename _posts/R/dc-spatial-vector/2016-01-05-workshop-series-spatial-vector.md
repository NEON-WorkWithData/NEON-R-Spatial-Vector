##Workshop: Vector Data - Shapefiles in R
This **tutorials that comprise this workshop ** cover how to 
open, work with and plot with spatial data, in vector format (points, lines and polygons) in R. 
Topics covered include working with spatial metadata: extent and coordinate reference system,
working with spatial attributes and plotting data by attributes. Data used
in this series cover NEON Harvard Forest Field Site and are in Shapefile and .csv
format.

**R Skill Level:** Beginner - you've got the basics of `R` down but haven't worked with
spatial data in `R` before.
